Overview

NOS-IR is the implementation framework for performing information retrieval directly on the Nuijens Operating System (NOS) — a dual-hemisphere, inverse-spherical computational geometry with native resolution R = 512 and a 720° cycle.

Rather than treating text as points in a vector space, NOS-IR compiles information into phase-geometric identities on the DH¹ dual-hemisphere sphere. Retrieval is executed as inverse-state resonance, inherited directly from the NOS kernel.

NOS-IR is the category.
CIC (Cromelin Information Compiler) is the canonical compiler within it.

Key Concepts
Nuijens Operating System (NOS)

As defined in NOS v4.8 and related papers, NOS is a computational operating system, not a metaphor:

Dual hemisphere sphere DH¹

Resolution R = 512

Double-covered 720° phase cycle

Quadrants Q1–Q4 (quantum baseline, EM/gravity, thermodynamic flow, nuclear compression)

Seam-centered inverse counting

Operators: dcos°, dsin°, ccos°, csin°

Inverse-state kernel DH⁻¹(Q)

Physics, fields, thermodynamics, and nuclear binding are executed as inverse phase computations.

NOS-IR extends this to information.
CIC is the mechanism.

The Cromelin Information Compiler (CIC)

CIC is the NOS-native information compiler.
It transforms text into complex, seam-normalized waveforms whose dominant spectral components correspond to:

Hemispheric operations

Quadrant threading units

Inverse depth states

Phase-bin structure compatible with DH¹

Retrieval uses the inverse-state resonance kernel, which combines:

Magnitude agreement

Phase alignment

Seam-relative geometry

Quadrant-conditioned interference

All without:

gradient descent

vector similarity

probabilistic scoring

stochastic training

Empirical Performance

CIC has been validated at 1,000,000 documents on the TREC DL 2019 passage benchmark:

MRR@10 ≈ 0.90

nDCG@10 ≈ 0.76

Fully deterministic

No ANN, no indexing shortcuts

Pure full-scan resonance

4 KB/trace memory footprint
